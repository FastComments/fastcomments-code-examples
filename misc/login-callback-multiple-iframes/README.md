This is a demo of FastComments SSO inside multiple iframes, to demonstrate how to pass the loginCallback up to the top iframe.

This will work as-is since it uses a pre-created demo account, however in production you'd have to define your own secret key and tenant id.

To run, run "npm install && npm run start" and open http://localhost:3003
